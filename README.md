##Calculator App (Python) 🧮

This project is a simple command-line calculator written in Python.  
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and continue calculations using the previous result.

The project is part of the **Udemy – 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.

##Features ✨

- Supports basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Uses functions for each operation
- Uses a dictionary to map operators to functions
- Allows the user to:
  - Continue calculating with the current result
  - Start a new calculation by restarting the program
- Displays an ASCII art logo at startup

##How It Works ▶️

1. The program prints a calculator logo.
2. The user enters the first number.
3. The user selects an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
4. The user enters the next number.
5. The program calculates and prints the result.
6. The user can choose to:
   - Continue calculating with the current result
   - End the program and start a new calculation manually

##Example Usage 🧠

What's the first number?: 10
+
-
*
/
Pick an operation: *
What's the next number?: 5
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 50.0 or 'n' to start new calculation: y
